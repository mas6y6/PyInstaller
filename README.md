# PyInstaller
This is a python installer to install python to a USB Drive because the regular python installer is buggy

## Why use this??
The reason why is because the main python installer is buggy and thinks that you do not need it but you want python protable usb drive

## Disclamer
**WARNING** Windows defender alarms will trigger and will prevent the executable from running. To prevent this use this [Link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) to help you out!
**IF** and only if you are still paranoid about this I have included the [main](https://github.com/mas6y6/PyInstaller/blob/main/main.py) python file for you to examine it. But there is no suspicious code in it though.
